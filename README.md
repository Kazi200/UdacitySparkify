## Libraries used
 - pyspark.sql
 - pyspark.ml
 - sklearn.metrics
 - pandas
 
## Project motivation
The motivation in this project is solely my desire to acquaint myself with Spark. 
This project was a great foray into how Spark works, its benefits, and machine learning with the tool.   

## File and description
- Sparkify.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with all code used for this project 
- mini_sparkify_event_data.json - JSON file containing the mini dataset used for this project 
- ModelData_1.csv - Interim file with full set of features and scaled features. Used so as not to redo scaling which took some time

## Results 
Using the data provided, we were able to engineer a set of features that allowed us to build a predictive model that can predict whether a user will churn reasonable accuracy.
